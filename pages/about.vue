      <summary>About</summary>
        <p>Over time my work has evolved to center around community. I enjoy working with process and find this just as important as the outcome. I assemble websites, do visuals for club environments, make radio and enjoy a wild swim amongst other things.</p>
        <p>I'm currently working as a freelancer in Berlin and looking for work in web, radio and club visuals projects. Please get in touch if you think hi[at]jackmurraybrown.com.</p>
        <p>Thanks for visiting and I hope you enjoy having a look around.</p>
