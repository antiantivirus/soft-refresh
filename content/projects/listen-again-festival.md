In the summer of 2019 I founded and ran the first edition of the Listen Again Festival, as a fringe festival to the [Look Again Festival](https://lookagainaberdeen.co.uk/).

The program for Listen Again 2019 involved; an algorave (live coding electronic music), the first in scotland to feature local live coding artists plus PC Music artist Lil Data, held alongside a live coding workshop; performance of two programmed arduinos inside now closed, soon to be demolished Aberdeen Market; a workshop on responsive audio and sensor processing; a discussion evening on the histories of and old narratives of club culture in aberdeen; takeover of 2day radio, a community radio project based in Aberdeen.
