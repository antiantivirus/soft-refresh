D2 is a DIY events space and community of Artist, DJs, VJs and creatives based in Aberdeen. It focuses on experimental music, performance and immersive club experiences. Born out of a lack of intimate DIY spaces in the city we promote diversity and a safe space for all.

Since founding it in 2018, I've been a key member of the community, helping to faciliate events and workshops at the space whilst also running monthly round-tables.
