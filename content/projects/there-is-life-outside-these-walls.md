Two neural networks dreaming

Installation shown as part of Monami exhibition (13/03/20) curated by [Veronica Petukhov](https://www.vncptk.tumblr.com/), at The Tunnels.

‘There is life outside these walls’ considered the current climate of social media and the web as its moves increasingly towards a series of walled gardens. How might we reflect on rave culture, net communities of the past and agricultural practises to bring about a change in our current digital rituals. Eåxploring neural networks, sms and inter-connected ecosystems to create two living/dreaming entities.
