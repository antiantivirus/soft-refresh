Aberdeen Rave Line is a phone number setup to provide information on the latest raves happening in the Aberdeen area.

Offering a way to move outsie of the 'walled gardens' of social media, users can text rave to 07727 710020 to recieve updates on the latest raves.

A series of analog advertising campaigns have been run to get the word out above the rave live. These have included a series of riso printed poster paste ups and will soon include a raveline phonebook.
