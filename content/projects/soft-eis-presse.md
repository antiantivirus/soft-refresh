Web development and design for SOFT EIS, an independent print magazine published in Berlin. Each issue deconstructs a different topic by exploring the dualities of ideas and all the conversations in between.

The website aimed to place the user in Berlin, reading a copy of the magazine. A webcam placed as the background of the website meant that the user was connected directly to Berlin on each and every visit.
