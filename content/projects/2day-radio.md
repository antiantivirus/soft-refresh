Web development and studio assistance for 2day radio, a community radio project that ran between 2018 and 2020.

2dayradio was a temporary community radio project, hosting creatives and local artists from within and around Aberdeen. It broadcast from various locations including the Worm Gallery, Temple of Jackie (Listen Again 2019) and was involved in the re-opening of Aberdeen Art Gallery. This version of the website was made to accompany the broadcast as part of the opening weekend of the Aberdeen Art Gallery.
