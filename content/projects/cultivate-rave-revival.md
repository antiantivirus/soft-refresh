Reviving old rave graphics for Cultivate's 2021 edition.

Mapped across 4 seperate LED panels, I produced visuals that explored old rave graphics and the cultivation of grafitti in Aberdeen. Mixing re-purposed rave graphics made into 3D figures with quick snapshots of graffiti from across Aberdeen to create an immersive visual experience.

Exploring the 90s rave aesthetics of DIY/rough and ready these visuals matched the aesthics of the surrounding bare scaffolding that the LED Panels were attached too.
