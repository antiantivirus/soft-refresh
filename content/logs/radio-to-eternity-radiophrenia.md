Thrilled to be launching a new podcast as part of my output under [Underground Radio Directory](https://www.undergroundradiodirectory.com/). Radio to Eternity will explore experimental and community radio across the globe. First up its Glasgow based Radiophrenia. It's just not eternal by name, all episodes will be stored eternily on the [arweave](https://www.arweave.org/). You can listen to the first episode [here](https://www.mixcloud.com/radiotoeternity/radiophrenia-to-eternity/). Out to [Verity Pease](https://verity-pease.com/) for the amazing artwork for this years edition and to Mark and Barry for the lovely chat.
