Fruitful.FM was a temporary radio station housed inside a greenhouse. Flipping the traditional ‘dead’ and hidden (terra incognita) space of a radio studio on its head. Across discussion, live-to-air performances, generative sounds, DJ sets and pre-recorded shows the station explored ecology, folk beliefs, community gardening, environmental issues and the North East of Scotland's musical heritage.

Installed inside the greenhouse was SwampNET, a weather station monitoring multiple parameters including temperature, humidity and soil moisture. An API connects SwampNET to the wider ecosystem and allows listeners to observe the studio conditions from further afield. Generative audio and regular announcements connect you, the listener, directly to the studio via its ever-changing conditions.

Broadcasting as part of Terra Incognita and the wider Wonderland Festival, Fruitful.FM was situated at the St Nicholas Roof Garden in Aberdeen's city centre.
