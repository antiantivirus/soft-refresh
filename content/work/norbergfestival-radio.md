Norbergfestival is a 22-year running festival, held on the abandoned iron mine site of [Mimerlaven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4OZdIGofuQ) in Norberg, Sweden.


In the summer of 2022 I co-ordinated the radio station as part of the Festival. Broadcasting online and on FM in the Norberg area the programme featured radio dramas, interviews with artists including: Moonilena; SØS Gunver Ryberg; Tianzhuo Chen, volunteers and the attending festival guests, a collaboration with Mimerlaven's legendary 40 secs of pure reverb, and the return of the famous 8-minute bonanza.

For the second day of broadcasting, Malmö based community radio station [Retreat Radio](https://www.retreatradio.net/) took over the orb. Programming the likes of Himera, Ryong and Lulu.

Housed inside a transparent bubble with a capsule like entrance ritual, the studio conditions were particularly challenging. However they proved rewarding in the visibility the radio had on the festival grounds.
