Web development and design for SOFT EIS, an independent print magazine published in Berlin. Each issue deconstructs a different topic by exploring the dualities of ideas and all the conversations in between.

The website aimed to place the user in Berlin, reading a copy of the magazine. A webcam placed as the background of the website meant that the user was connected directly to Berlin on each and every visit, be it snowing, sunny or someone crossing the road.
