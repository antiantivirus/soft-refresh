Showing the best in world wide wadio.

In 2018 I launched the Underground Radio Directory, which aims to bring together the best in underground net radio stations from across the globe. Through this site I have been collating stations across the world/web into one listenable place allowing the user to discover new stations, listen to their favourites and explore the world of net radio. I will be launching a podcast at the start of February 2022 aiming to explore underground radio further, with the first episode featuring glasgow based [Radiophrenia](https://radiophrenia.scot/)
